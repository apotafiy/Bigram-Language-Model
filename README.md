# Bigram-Language-Model
This project uses the novel Middlemarch by George Eliot to generate text that mimics the text of the novel. It used bigram word pairs to determine which words is most likely to com asfter the other. The GUI asks for one word (a seed) and an integer to determine how long the text will be.

This project originally started as a school assignment, but I liked it so much that I improved and expanded it. My improvements were better word generation (it doesn't get into loops anymore) and now it has a GUI.
